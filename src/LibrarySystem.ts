// ðŸ“š Create a simple Library System where users can add books, borrow books, return books, and check availability.
// 1. Create an enum called BookGenre with at least 5 book genres.
// 2. Create a type alias called Book which contains: bookId (number), title (string), author (string), genre (BookGenre), isAvailable (boolean).
// 3. Create a function called addBook which will add a new book into the library array. The function needs to return a Book object.
// 4. Create a function called borrowBook which will change the bookâ€™s availability to false if available. The return needs to be a string.
// 5. Create a function called returnBook which will change the bookâ€™s availability to true. The return needs to be a string.
// 6. Create a function called checkAvailability which will return true if the book is available and false otherwise.
// 7. Create a function called removeBook which will remove a book from the library array. The return needs to be a string.
