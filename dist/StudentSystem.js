// 🏫 Create a Student Management System where students can be added, marked as passed/failed, and checked for status.
// 1. Create a union literal type called StudentStatus that can be "active", "graduated", or "dropped".
// 2. Create a type alias called Student which contains: studentId (number), name (string), age (number), subjects (string[]), status (StudentStatus).
// 3. Create a function called addStudent which will add a student to the students array. The function needs to return a Student object.
// 4. Create a function called updateStatus which updates a student's status. The return needs to be a string.
// 5. Create a function called addSubject which adds a subject to a student’s subjects array. The return needs to be a string.
// 6. Create a function called getStudent which returns a student’s information based on studentId.
